        "In Course 1 of this specialization, you saw how to use a CNN to make your recognition of computer generated images of horses and humans more efficient. In this lesson, you'll take that to the next level: building a model to classify real images of cats and dogs. Like the horses and humans dataset, real-world images also come in different shapes, aspect ratios, etc. and you will need to take this into account when preparing your data.\n",

For instance, if you, as a human, only see three images of people who are lumberjacks, and three images of people who are sailors, and among them the only person wearing a cap is a lumberjack, you might start thinking that wearing a cap is a sign of being a lumberjack as opposed to a sailor.
