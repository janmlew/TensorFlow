By default, it will pad according to the length of the longest sequence. You can override this with the maxlen argument to define a specific length. Feel free to play with the [other arguments](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/sequence/pad_sequences#args) shown in class and compare the result."
